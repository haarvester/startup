Infrastructure Setup Plan for a Python Startup (CI/CD + GitOps + Kubernetes)

1. Goal

Deploy a cost-efficient, scalable, and fully automated infrastructure for Python microservices using:

DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) for hosting
GitHub Actions for CI/CD
ArgoCD for GitOps-based delivery
DigitalOcean Container Registry for Docker images
PostgreSQL via Helm chart (or later, managed service)
Test and Production environments based on Git branches

2.  Cloud Platform ‚Äî DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)

Reasons:
Low cost and easy to manage
Built-in LoadBalancer, Persistent Volumes, Ingress, and Registry
GitHub integration and Terraform-ready
Initial Setup:
1 control plane node (managed, free)
2 worker nodes (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM each)
Total estimated monthly cost: ~$50‚Äì60

Deployment Architecture Options: test vs prod Separation

You can structure your Kubernetes environments (test and prod) in three main ways, depending on your budget, security, and operational complexity.

‚úÖ Option 1: Single Cluster, Single Node Pool, Two Namespaces (BASIC)

üîß Description:
One Kubernetes cluster
One shared node pool
Two isolated namespaces: test and prod
GitOps handles deployments to respective namespaces based on Git branches
‚ûï Pros:
Very low cost (~$50/month)
Simple to set up and maintain
Unified monitoring and GitOps flow
‚ûñ Cons:
No physical isolation ‚Äî test environment may impact prod
Shared node resources (CPU/memory) could cause conflicts during high load
üü® Option 2: Single Cluster, Multiple Node Pools, Two Namespaces (RECOMMENDED)

üîß Description:
One Kubernetes cluster
Two dedicated node pools:
pool-test: low-cost nodes (e.g., 1vCPU/2GB)
pool-prod: higher-performance nodes (e.g., 2vCPU/4GB)
Workloads are scheduled using nodeSelector and tolerations
Still using GitOps with two namespaces (test, prod)
‚ûï Pros:
Good resource isolation between test and prod
Optimized cost by assigning cheaper nodes to test workloads
Centralized CI/CD and ArgoCD
‚ûñ Cons:
Slightly more complex (need to configure scheduling logic)
Still shares control-plane and API server (not fully isolated)

 Option 3: Two Separate Clusters (ENTERPRISE-GRADE)

üîß Description:
Two completely separate Kubernetes clusters:
k8s-startup-test
k8s-startup-prod
Optionally, each with its own ArgoCD instance
Can be hosted in different regions or even different cloud accounts
‚ûï Pros:
Full isolation: security, failure domain, and performance
Enables independent cluster upgrades and operations
Best for compliance-sensitive or high-availability environments
‚ûñ Cons:
Most expensive (~$100+/month)
Operationally more complex:
Two kubeconfigs
Separate ArgoCD apps or sync mechanisms
Separate secrets, pipelines, etc.


Option	GitHub Actions CI/CD Adjustment
Option 1	Deploy to correct namespace (test or prod)
Option 2	Add nodeSelector and tolerations in Helm values
Option 3	Separate CI steps or jobs for each cluster with different kubeconfigs and GitOps repos


Full CI/CD and GitOps Setup for Python Services using GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, and DigitalOcean Kubernetes

1. üîê GitHub Secrets Setup

In your GitHub repository, configure the following Secrets under Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions:

Name	Description
DOCKER_REGISTRY	DigitalOcean registry endpoint (e.g., registry.digitalocean.com/startup-registry)
DOCKER_USERNAME	Your Docker Hub or DOCTL username
DOCKER_PASSWORD	Personal Access Token or output from doctl registry docker-config
GIT_EMAIL	Git user email used for committing updated values files
GIT_USERNAME	Git user name (e.g., github-actions)
ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN (optional)	ArgoCD API token if auto-syncing from pipeline is needed


2. ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
   
name: CI/CD Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - test
      - main

env:
  IMAGE_NAME: my-python-app
  REGISTRY: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REGISTRY }}

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

    - name: Log in to Docker registry
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
        registry: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REGISTRY }}
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Build and push Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t $REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:${{ github.sha }} .
        docker push $REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:${{ github.sha }}

    - name: Update Helm values
      run: |
        BRANCH=${GITHUB_REF##*/}
        VALUES_FILE=infra/argo-apps/$BRANCH/values.yaml

        git config --global user.email "${{ secrets.GIT_EMAIL }}"
        git config --global user.name "${{ secrets.GIT_USERNAME }}"

        sed -i "s|tag:.*|tag: ${{ github.sha }}|" $VALUES_FILE
        git add $VALUES_FILE
        git commit -m "Update image tag for $BRANCH environment"
        git push

3. üîÅ ArgoCD Installation

Install ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster

4. üéØ ArgoCD Applications

Create two ArgoCD Application manifests:

test-app.yaml (for test branch):

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: myapp-test
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/infrastructure
    path: argo-apps/test
    targetRevision: test
    helm:
      valueFiles:
        - values.yaml
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: test
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true

Repeat for prod-app.yaml with targetRevision: main and namespace: prod.

5. üì¶ Helm Chart Structure (Example for Python App)

File: values.yaml

image:
  repository: registry.digitalocean.com/startup-registry/my-python-app
  tag: latest

service:
  port: 8000

env:
  DATABASE_URL: postgresql://user:pass@postgres-service:5432/mydb


6. üêò PostgreSQL Setup via Helm

Install PostgreSQL separately in each namespace or cluster

8. üìâ Estimated Monthly Cost Summary
   | Component                   | Estimated Monthly Cost            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Kubernetes Nodes (2x 2vCPU) | \~\$48                            |
| Container Registry          | Free (up to 5,000 pulls/month)    |
| PostgreSQL via Helm         | \~\$0 (runs inside cluster nodes) |
| ArgoCD                      | Free (open source)                |
| **Total**                   | **\~\$50‚Äì60/month**               |


üìä Monitoring & üîç Logging Setup (Recommended for CI/CD-Based Startup)

To ensure system stability and observability, you should also set up monitoring and logging for your Kubernetes cluster.

1. üìä Monitoring ‚Äî Prometheus + Grafana
üîß What it does:

Prometheus scrapes metrics from applications, nodes, and Kubernetes components.
Grafana provides dashboards and alerts based on those metrics.

2. üîç Logging ‚Äî Grafana Loki + Promtail
üîß What it does:

Loki is a lightweight log aggregation system (like ELK but simpler).
Promtail collects logs from all pods and sends them to Loki.
You view logs in Grafana side-by-side with metrics.
